<h2 id="major_assign">Major Assignments</h2>
<h3>Weekly Readings Response</h3>
<p>Each week, you'll have an assigned response to our readings. This response will ask that you talk about the impact of the particular readings for a given week, integrate those readings into a broader context, and apply them to your own profession/workplace. These responses will vary from assignment topics to open responses with minimal guidance.</p>

<h3>Sandbox Site</h3>
<p>Each week, you'll maintain a sandbox site via the university's COMP server. You'll be expected to use this site to try out some of the techniques we'll be discussing in readings each week, and often you'll be tasked between classes to implement a planned site feature that we've covered during our weekly meeting. This work at times (perhaps often) will be collaborative, and will provide you a space to freely test out ideas and push your skills in formatting content for the web. A content management site will eventually accompany this sandbox site when we transition to the second half of the semester.</p>

<h3>Site Critique</h3>
<p>For our first major assignment with a due date, you'll complete a critique of an existing site. Your critique will need to integrate our readings on visual rhetoric, usability, as well as usability testing of the site in question.</p>

<h3>Site Project Part 1</h3>
<p>For the first part of your site project, you will need to propose working with a client or on your own personal project for a website or equivalent work with HTML/CSS or a content management system. Your initial project report will map out the stakeholders for the project, the purpose, goals, markers for success, and a timeline for your work.</p>

<h3>Site Project Part 2</h3>
<p>The final portion of your project will be the submission of the site or equivalent work, along with a report on the project. The report should include a summary of your project, your design choices, your rationale for those choices, and the results of your usability testing on the site or equivalent project.</p>

<h2 id="participation">Classroom Participation</h2>
<h3>Github Account</h3>
<p>As part of your participation in the course, you'll be expected to maintain a Github account (we'll go over this early on) that will serve as a backup for your HTML/CSS projects. These accounts will also support teamwork from time to time.</p>

<h3>In-Class Team Projects</h3>
<p>During the semester, we'll often have a team project that will serve as the focus for our application of the week's readings. You'll work in pairs or threes to put together a project that makes use of the content we've discussed in that week's readings (and previous readings) to solve a particular problem. These projects at times will leak over into your sandbox site work.</p>

<h3>In-Class Technique Sharing</h3>
<p>From time to time we'll work together to educate each other in class as to specific techniques that we've found useful for shaping content for the web. You'll be asked from time to time to share a particularly effective technique that you discovered with the rest of the class in an informal fashion.</p>

<h3>Discussions</h3>
<p>You'll be expected to take part in classroom discussions that will be the driving force of many of our face-to-face meetings. Respectful participation is expected.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Assignment &amp; Late Work Policy</h2>
The below regarding attendance is taken directly from the faculty handbook, located at <a href="http://provost.uark.edu/91.php">http://provost.uark.edu/91.php</a>.

<h3>University Policy</h3>
<i><p>Education at the university level requires active involvement in the learning process. Therefore students have the responsibility to attend classes and to actively engage in all learning assignments or opportunities provided in their classes. Instructors have the responsibility to provide a written policy on student attendance that is tied to course objectives and included in a course syllabus. There may be times, however, when illness, family crisis, or university-sponsored activities make full attendance or participation impossible. In these situations students are responsible for making timely arrangements with the instructor to make up work missed. Such arrangements should be made in writing and prior to the absence when possible.<br/><br/>
Examples of absences that should be considered excusable include those resulting from the following: 1) illness of the student, 2) serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or other family crisis, 3) University-sponsored activities for which the student's attendance is required by virtue of scholarship or leadership/participation responsibilities, 4) religious observances (see Students' Religious Observances policy below), 5) jury duty or subpoena for court appearance, and 6) military duty. The instructor has the right to require that the student provide appropriate documentation for any absence for which the student wishes to be excused.</p></i>

<h3>Our Classroom Policy</h3>
<p>For our purposes, attendance will be a requirement of this course, and absence from the course will negatively impact your final grade. As this is a one a week graduate course, you should not expect to miss more than two class periods. If you miss more than two classes, I reserve the right to fail you from the course.<br><br/>
Any absences that qualify as excused absences, as described above by university policy, must be reported as excused to the instructor within one class period of your return to class. If you are sick, I am quite happy with you staying home and not sharing your illness with us all, but you must let me know about that excused nature of the absence upon your return.</p>

<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>If you are absent on the date an assignment is due and you fail to turn in that assignment, it will be graded as a F for 0 credit. For a major assignment, this can be catastrophic to your final grade In the course. If for some reason you know ahead of time you will not have an assignment due on time, please seek an extension from me via email or face-to-face. If you ask for an extension, you may be granted one if the circumstances make sense. If you don't ask for an extension until after the assignment is due, the assignment cannot be made up.<br/></br/>
If you have work that is late and you are unable to attend due to illness or a university-recognized excused absence, your work should be made up as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of students to find out about any missed assignments: I will not search you out to let you know about assignments you have missed.</p>
