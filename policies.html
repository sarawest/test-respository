<h2 id="academic_int">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p><blockquote>"As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is possible only when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail. Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with, and abide by, the University's 'Academic Integrity Policy,' which may be found at <a href="http://provost.uark.edu/academicintegrity/245.php">http://provost.uark.edu/academicintegrity/245.php</a>. Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor."<br/>
— Office of the Provost and Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs</blockquote>

<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal antidiscrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the University of Arkansas Academic Policy Series 1520.10 requires that students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact me privately at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through the Center for Educational Access (contact 479–575–3104 or visit <a href="http://cea.uark.edu">http://cea.uark.edu</a> for more information on registration procedures).
