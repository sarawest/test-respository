<h2 id="academic_int">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p><blockquote>"As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is possible only when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail. Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with, and abide by, the University's 'Academic Integrity Policy,' which may be found at <a href="http://provost.uark.edu/academicintegrity/245.php">http://provost.uark.edu/academicintegrity/245.php</a>. Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor."<br/>
--Office of the Provost and Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs</blockquote>

<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal antidiscrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the University of Arkansas Academic Policy Series 1520.10 requires that students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact me privately at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through the Center for Educational Access (contact 479–575–3104 or visit <a href="http://cea.uark.edu">http://cea.uark.edu</a> for more information on registration procedures).

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance &amp; Late Work</h2>
The below regarding attendance is taken directly from the faculty handbook, located at <a href="http://provost.uark.edu/91.php">http://provost.uark.edu/91.php</a>.

<h3>University Policy</h3>
<i><p>Education at the university level requires active involvement in the learning process. Therefore students have the responsibility to attend classes and to actively engage in all learning assignments or opportunities provided in their classes. Instructors have the responsibility to provide a written policy on student attendance that is tied to course objectives and included in a course syllabus. There may be times, however, when illness, family crisis, or university-sponsored activities make full attendance or participation impossible. In these situations students are responsible for making timely arrangements with the instructor to make up work missed. Such arrangements should be made in writing and prior to the absence when possible.<br/><br/>
Examples of absences that should be considered excusable include those resulting from the following: 1) illness of the student, 2) serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or other family crisis, 3) University-sponsored activities for which the student's attendance is required by virtue of scholarship or leadership/participation responsibilities, 4) religious observances (see Students' Religious Observances policy below), 5) jury duty or subpoena for court appearance, and 6) military duty. The instructor has the right to require that the student provide appropriate documentation for any absence for which the student wishes to be excused.</p></i>

<h3>Our Classroom Policy</h3>
<p>For our purposes, attendance will be a requirement of this course, and absence from the course will negatively impact your final grade. As this is a one a week graduate course, you should not expect to miss more than two class periods. If you miss more than two classes, I reserve the right to fail you from the course.<br><br/>
Any absences that qualify as excused absences, as described above by university policy, must be reported as excused to the instructor within one class period of your return to class. If you are sick, I am quite happy with you staying home and not sharing your illness with us all, but you must let me know about that excused nature of the absence upon your return.</p>

<h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>If you are absent on the date an assignment is due and you fail to turn in that assignment, it will be graded as a F for 0 credit. For a major assignment, this can be catastrophic to your final grade In the course. If for some reason you know ahead of time you will not have an assignment due on time, please seek an extension from me via email or face-to-face. If you ask for an extension, you may be granted one if the circumstances make sense. If you don't ask for an extension until after the assignment is due, the assignment cannot be made up.<br/></br/>
If you have work that is late and you are unable to attend due to illness or a university-recognized excused absence, your work should be made up as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of students to find out about any missed assignments: I will not search you out to let you know about assignments you have missed.</p>

<h2 id="weather_safe">Weather &amp; Safety</h2>
<h3>Cancellation of Class</h3>
<p>In the event that class must be cancelled, I will notify you via Blackboard and email. I will strive to notify you by noon on the date we will not have class.</p>

<h3>Inclement Weather</h3>
<p>In the case of inclement weather, we will not have class. Please keep an eye on local weather postings for potential hazards. You should be notified by noon on the day of class if we will not be having class due to inclement weather.</p>

<h3>Active Shooter</h3>
<p>In the event of an active shooter, do not attempt to come to class. Follow the university guidelines for such events in the location you are at. If there is an active shooter during class, we will follow university guidelines.</p>

<h3>Hazardous Weather/Fire</h3>
<p>In the event of hazardous weather such as flood, tornado, etc., do not come to class. If we are in class, we will proceed to the safe locations identified for that building. In the event of a fire, do not attempt to attend class. If we are having class during a fire we will exit the building via the recommended evacuation route.</p>

<h3>Course Disruption</h3>
<p>In the event that a violent event disrupts the university's normal operation, the course will not continue as noted in this syllabus and changes may be made to react to any extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<h3>Discrimination and Sexual Harassment</h3>
<p>Anyone experiencing discrimination and/or sexual harassment while at the university may report it to a complaint officer appointed by the Chancellor. The complaint officer will discuss any situation or event that the complainant considers discriminatory or constitutive of sexual harassment. Reports may be made by the person experiencing the harassment or by a third party, such as a witness to the harassment or someone who is told of the harassment. For more information and to report allegations of discrimination and/or sexual harassment, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance, 346 N. West Avenue (West Avenue Annex), 479-575-4019 (voice) or 479-575-3646 (tdd).</p>

You do not have my permission to record our class without prior consent, and you may not post or sell notes online without my permission.
